# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      I'm Joe Mahoney and this is my website.

      I'm all over the web, usually under the handle "cheerschopper". The best way
      to get in touch with me is via Twitter. But if you want to "friend" me on other services, 
      that's cool too.

    intro: |
      Over the years I've tried and abandoned quite a few blogging services and tools, 
      the longest serving of which is probably [my tumblr](http://cheerschopper.tumblr.com).
      This archive collects a few posts from the old days and any writing published since 
      the middle of 2013. There's also a [feed](<link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://iterative.co.nz/feed"/>)
      for your RSS reader of choice.
