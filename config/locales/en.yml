# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    intro: |
      I've started and restarted my blog oh so many times. Around 2000 I had an EditThisPage
      blog. I rolled my own blog tool in ColdFusion when I was first put in charge of a server.
      I ignored a LiveJournal for about three years. Over the last few years 
      I've been sporadically updating more than one Tumblr.
      And now your're looking at a [Woodsman](https://github.com/jmahoney/woodsman) powered blog.
    monthly: |
      You can browse through the archive a month at a time. Hopefully I'll eventually have written 
      enough to make a monthly archive worthwhile.
